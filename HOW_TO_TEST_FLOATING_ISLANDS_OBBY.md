# How to Play & Test Floating Islands Obby

## **Quick Steps to Test:**

### **Step 1: Make Sure Your Script is in Roblox Studio**
1. Open **Roblox Studio**
2. Click **ServerScriptService** in the Explorer (right panel)
3. Check if your generated script is there
4. If not, create a new **Script** in ServerScriptService and paste the generated code

### **Step 2: Click Play Button**
1. Click the **Play** button (green play icon at the top of Roblox Studio)
2. Your character will spawn in the game

### **Step 3: How to Move & Play**
- **W** = Move forward
- **A** = Move left  
- **S** = Move backward
- **D** = Move right
- **Mouse** = Look around (move mouse to turn camera)
- **Space** = Jump
- **Shift** = Sprint (run faster)

### **Step 4: What to Look For**
1. **Starting Platform** - You should spawn on a large glowing platform
2. **Floating Islands** - Look around for other large platforms floating in the air
3. **Moving Obstacles** - Yellow glowing prisms/blocks that are rotating or moving
4. **Gaps** - Large gaps between platforms (you need to jump far)
5. **Finish Platform** - A large platform at the end (usually green color)

### **Step 5: How to Play**
1. **Jump** from platform to platform
2. **Avoid** the moving obstacles (yellow glowing shapes)
3. **Touch checkpoints** (if they exist) to save your progress
4. **Reach** the finish platform to complete the game

### **Step 6: What to Check for 10/10 Rating**
✅ **Platforms floating high** (not on ground, should be in the air)
✅ **5-7 platforms total** (should see multiple islands)
✅ **Large gaps** (40-60 studs between platforms - need BIG jumps)
✅ **Moving obstacles** (yellow shapes spinning/moving)
✅ **Irregular placement** (platforms in different directions, not straight line)
✅ **Platforms are large** (30-40 studs wide - like islands)

## **If Something is Wrong:**

### **Platforms on Ground:**
- They should be floating at Y > 18 (in the air)
- Check if you see platforms high up above the baseplate

### **Only 1-2 Platforms:**
- Should see 5-7 platforms total
- Look around in all directions (move camera)

### **Moving Obstacles Not Moving:**
- Yellow glowing shapes should be rotating/spinning
- If they're static, the movement code isn't working

### **Platforms Too Close:**
- Should need BIG jumps to reach next platform
- If you can easily walk between them, gaps are too small

### **Platforms in a Straight Line:**
- Should be scattered in different directions
- Not all in one line - should go left, right, forward, backward

## **Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Can see multiple floating platforms
- [ ] Platforms are high in the air (not on ground)
- [ ] Can see 5-7 platforms total
- [ ] Yellow obstacles are moving/spinning
- [ ] Need big jumps to reach next platform
- [ ] Platforms are large (island-like size)
- [ ] Platforms are in different directions (not straight line)

**If all checkboxes are ✅, it's 10/10!** 🎉
