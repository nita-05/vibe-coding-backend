## 💡 Prompt Writing Tips

### ✅ **DO:**
- **Be specific**: "50 coins" instead of "some coins"
- **List features clearly**: Use bullet points or numbered lists
- **Mention UI elements**: "Score UI in top-left corner"
- **Describe visuals**: "glowing yellow coins", "red obstacles"
- **Include win conditions**: "Win when player collects 25 coins"

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- ❌ "Make a game" (too vague)
- ❌ "Something fun" (not specific)
- ❌ "A complex RPG" (too complicated for first try)
- ❌ "Like Fortnite" (too complex, be specific about features)

## 🔄 How to Refine Your Game (Iterative Process)

After generating, use the **AI Panel** to refine:

### **Step 1: Generate Initial Game**
```
Create a coin collector game with 50 coins and score UI
```

### **Step 2: Refine with Follow-up Prompts**

**In AI Panel, ask:**
```
"Add 50 more coins to make it 100 total"
```

```
"Make the obstacles move back and forth"
```

```
"Add a timer that counts down from 60 seconds"
```

```
"Change coins to be blue instead of yellow"
```

```
"Add a power-up that doubles coin value for 10 seconds"
```

```
"Make the player move faster"
```

```
"Add sound effects when collecting coins"
```

### **Step 3: Fix Issues**

**If something doesn't work:**
```
"Fix the coin collection - coins aren't disappearing when touched"
```

```
"The score UI isn't updating, fix it"
```

```
"Player dies immediately on spawn, fix the obstacle collision"
```
